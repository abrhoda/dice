# dice
pratt parser for dice expressions to learn some go

## TODO
 - [ ] parser.Buffer should also be able to be accessed for ease of switching the `buffer []byte` var. Allowing `parser.Buffer = someOtherByteSlice` on an already initialized parser so subsequent `parser.Parse()` calls can be made with new buffers.
 - [ ] Address NOTE/TODO comments in code.
 - [ ] Address `*_test.go` TODO items.
